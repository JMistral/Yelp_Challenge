The ingredients were not as fresh as you would wanted....don't order anything with Unagi, it is disgusting.  However, some of the tofu dish was not bad and sushi was ok. They have one of those rule of not leaving food behind but this could be a touture when some dish doesn't taste good. If you have dinner buffet, they have sashimi salads in various way. Some of them with no mayo tasted much better than one with. Some of the appetizers were better tasting such as tofu, skewers and calamari. They do have various rolls and Maki for almost everyone's liking. Please note, if you are a hard core Japanese food person, this is not the place, but if you occasionally have Japanese food with your friends and family, you might like this place more than I do as they do have karaoke etc. I also saw lots of families dine here as well. This restaurant has 3 locations in Las Vegas, one on Decatur is the best one.\n",

He fixed it & he said total is 15 dollars or something & I said\" waaait hold on you told me the pizza was free\" he said \"no I said the deep dish pizza was free\" thats when I started getting mad.

      "Some may think it's expensive, but in Hawaii, a buffet for $55 will not get you much at all! Therefore, for ME, this place was a steal!! \n",

      "\n",
      "A good time to go would be about 4 - 4:30, before anyone gets hungry for dinner obviously. But seriously, I went at that time twice on a Thursday and Friday, and there was NO wait!\n",

      "    4 - \n",
      "Best buffet I've been to but everything still was.... Like eating at a buffet. None of the food items had a prime restaurant quality feel so the price tag knocks off one star. Do yourself a favor and try their salmon and rack of lamb. Both were great\n",

      "    3 - \n",
      "No thank you. Don't get me wrong some of the offerings on the buffet were great.  Especially the fresh squeezed juices. The lobster Benedict was excellent too. The problem with this place is the cost. Over priced and over rated. There are comparable buffets at less cost.\n",
      "\n",
      "Give the buffet at the M Resort a try. Not fancy but good home style cooking. Wine and champagne and I believe the beer is included.\n",
      "\n",
      "    2 - \n",
      "Expensive, cramped layout, and the food is fair at best. I imagine this was a better buffet when it opened. Now, it's just fair. The food selection is not what you would think judging from the pictures that I am sure Caesar's provides to media outlets including Yelp.\n",
      "\n",
      "You will pay for Valet parking, even as a guest, and don't forget Champagne is an additional charge.\n",
      "\n",
      "In the end, I would avoid this buffet. Expensive and not good. Fair is never worth 43.00 - 65.00 depending on what time you visit this buffet.\n",

      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 2:\n",
      "    5 - \n",
      "Was the best buffet I have ever been to. Had huge variety of meat desserts and sea food. I ate crab til I was sick, and then went back for more. Server was great and even showed me how to eat craw fish for the first time. Only dowmside was the line, and cost. 39 lunch before 3 pm and 54 for dinner.\n",
      "\n",
      "    3 - \n",
      "See food... Usually I see food and then I eat it! But this time I'm talking about seafood. To be fair you're going to need to read my review all the way through to understand why I'm giving them 3 stars. \n",
      "\n",
      "I am a breakfast fanatic and wanted to come for breakfast, unfortunately they only had breakfast brunch until 3 o'clock. (This is the average time in vegas that buffets serve breakfast). When in Vegas it's sometimes hard to get anywhere by then. I rushed my friends out of the room and we  to got to Caesars at 1:45 PM. Unfortunately I didn't realize that the wait could be hours long, I should've read the other reviews. They wouldn't be able to seat us till after 3 which means I was not going to get my breakfast buffet. Prices also go up after 3. \n",
      "\n",
      "We ended up getting seated at 3:15 which means the buffet has turned into dinner now. Even though the food was good and had a lot of seafood, my preference buffets with more choices. My friends who enjoy seafood loved this buffet so if you enjoy crab legs, crawfish, and other seafood you will probably enjoy this buffet. I ended up eating pizza, some Chinese food, and a few of their desserts but nothing really blew me away. They had someone preparing crepes and tacos, which was nice. The food is good but I prefer more selection at my buffets especially because I'm a picky eater who doesn't eat pork, red meat, or seafood. I would be willing to come back and try their breakfast brunch. \n",
      "\n",
      "Lastly this buffet is not cheap, be ready to roll out the dough. I paid about $60 and my friends added unlimited mimosas for about $70! At least they were drunk enough to forget how much they spent.\n",
      "\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 3:\n",
      "    5 - \n",
      "I made the rookie mistake of coming here when I was only hungry and not ravenous. Hungry doesn't cut it at this place. For $60 a person, you need to get your moneys worth. Luckily for paupers like me, they have a payment plan. 6 installments of $10 payments for half a year. Finally the elite are taking it easy on us. \n",
      "\n",
      "Just kidding, not a real thing. But yes, this place is $60 a person, so...really...if you're only kind of hungry, maybe put it off a day. \n",
      "\n",
      "What did they have? What didn't they have is a better question. Seriously, it's hard to fathom something they didn't have here...Mexican cuisine, CHECK. Chinese food, CHECK. Italian, CHECK. Unlimited steak off the grill? CHECK. The lack of Jewish cuisine was rather disappointing. I was looking forward to traditional kugel. \n",
      "\n",
      "I ate a lot of seafood. Clams, oysters, crab legs, shrimp (in like 6 different forms), chowder, etc...I also had the steak...which was surprisingly average. But a man named \"Jesus\" served it to me. He was actually the second person I met in Vegas named Jesus. Thought that was cool, and ironic for Vegas. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall the food is amazing. It is just terrific unlimited food everywhere. It is a paradise. So, 5 stars.\n",

      "    4 - \n",
      "I believe we paid about $60 for Saturday Brunch with bottomless mimosas. \n",

      "You walk over, enter your information into a kiosk and get a return time. In the past we would get a text to come back, but this time we just showed up at 2:00 for our 2:19 return time and it was chill.\n",
      "\n",
      "2:00 pm was perfect because we were able to grab a couple breakfast items just before dinner items came out. Also, since it's an in between eating time, it was a lot less crowded during the second half of our meal. We left satisfied; there's a big selection of food (just look at everyone else's pictures) and bottomless mimosas? It was just about a $7 add-on to the base price.\n",

      "    5 - \n",
      "This buffet is real quality! Prime rib is my favorite here not only because of the taste but also David, the gentleman who serves you the turkey, ribs, pork with great attitude! David, you are the BEST! Thank you.\n",

      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 5:\n",
      "    4 - \n",
      "The FOUR hour wait was worth it. You heard me right. Four...hours...of...hunger.\n",
      "\n",
      "I have some ideas on why the wait was four hours: 1) Father's Day weekend, 2) Caesar Palace's 50th Anniversary on a weekend, 3) EDC week, 4) Summer vacation, 5) one of the few remaining Las Vegas buffets that serve King Crab legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "The process is pretty simple. Go to a kioski, punch in your mobile phone number, go up the food agent (hostess?) and blabber about how long the wait is, leave the area and go shopping/drinking, come back within an hour of your wait, then eat! My cousin had a conspiracy theory (which is her normal state of mind): they want you to roam around, gamble, and spend money while you wait. She may have a point there.\n",
      "\n",
      "Once you get in line, there is another line. Sigh. We didn't know you could pay in advance to cut in line, but I don't think they were offering this tempting upgrade due to the heavy amount of people frequenting the buffet the day we went.\n",
      "\n",
      "The inside was spacious and clean and hardly any lines! It's ingenious how Bacchanal manages to let people in at staggered times to avoid Buffet Line Road Rage. The only \"line\" of 2-3 people were mostly gathered around the \"King Crab\" legs, which were super anemic-looking. I still have a sneaky suspicion they were Snow Crab Legs...it was still delicious with the warm, nutty clarified butter. We ate so much we felt a little queasy. \n",
      "\n",
      "I could go on and on about the food but I'm sure the 12,000 photos on Yelp will do the talking. It was worth the wait just so we could say we ate at the Bacchanal, but if you have hungry screaming kids, I'd avoid the Bacchanal during peak times and go elsewhere. \n",
      "\n",
      "We paid about $120 for the both of us, not including the tip.\n",
      "\n",
      "    3 - \n",
      "This place is very popular.  I tried to avoid the long line so went around 4pm. Still had to wait 30minutes. \n",
      "\n",
      "The buffet is overpriced. It is good but same as all the other buffet places. Nothing special. Wish they had more food options.\n",
      "\n",
      "==========\n",
      "Cluster 6:\n",
      "    5 - \n",
      "Where to even start? The 50 minute wait for a party of four? Expected (even pleasantly surprised - we thought it would be 90 minutes at least). The absolutely incredible feat of producing such a massive scale of good quality food? Well, it's Vegas. The diversity in the featured cuisines? That definitely caught me off guard. I hadn't read much about Bacchanal before my friends insisted that we go. Since I almost never eat at buffets, the only impression I had was of something like Old Country or Golden Corral (*cringes*). But Bacchanal changes the game. Seeing the rows of dishes inspired by American, Italian, Chinese, and Japanese cuisines made me SO unbelievably happy. Also, that doesn't even include the incredible seafood row as well as the entire DESSERT island. Plus, my friends and I got the mimosa pass as well, so endless bubblies were part of the experience too!! \n",
      "\n",
      "Must-try dishes (hopefully they keep these in the buffet!):\n",
      "1. Shrimp ceviche (seafood section) - so fucking good; the sauce is super savory and tangy \n",
      "2. Custard buns (Chinese dim sum section) - these were my favorite growing up, and they were so warm and fluffy and the custard was perfectly sweet (but not too sweet!)\n",
      "3. Sushi hand rolls (Japanese section) - these cute little hand rolls were yummy and adorably packaged...also the rest of the sushi was amazing as well\n",
      "4. Sticky rice in lotus leaf (Chinese dim sum section) - another favorite of mine; the rice was perfectly savory and sticky and the meat in the middle was delicious\n",
      "5. Guava something (dessert section) - not sure what it was called but it was sort of like a panna cotta and probably my favorite dessert; just delicately sweet, slightly tangy from the guava\n",
      "6. Jasmine rice pudding (dessert section) - warm rice pudding with a drizzle of honey at the bottom; I loved it because it was perfectly sweet and satisfying\n",
      "\n",
      "Strategies to succeed at Bacchanal without exploding your gut:\n",
      "1. If you're trying to taste as much as possible, only take a bite or two of each item...and then pass it over to your friend for her to try (vice versa)! I made the mistake of inhaling one of the custard buns in the beginning because that 50 min wait time had me STARVING. Rookie mistake. That custard bun actually filled me up quite a bit, and drinking all of those carbonated-af mimosas didn't help.\n",
      "2. Wear sweatpants or anything with a stretchy elastic waistband. Two of my friends wore jeans and had to unbutton their pants midway through the meal haha. \n",
      "3. Take a nice loooooong walk around the Strip afterwards. Or go on a leisurely hike or something. You'll feel so much better.\n",
      "\n",
      "So yeah, this was a pretty life-changing meal. I don't think I could do this more than once in a year. By the end of the meal, we all hated ourselves a little (but it was WORTH it). I definitely recommend Bacchanal, the feast for the gods.\n",
      "\n",
      "    5 - \n",
      "oh yes! If you want to go to an amazing BUFFET!... This is where you go to. It has everything under the roof! Asian, Mexican, Seafood, Delicious Desserts! etc.\n",

      "    3 - \n",
      "My boyfriend and I both had high expectations for this buffet, but we left feeling disappointed. We came on a thursday and it was $54.99/person. While there was a very wide variety of food selections, the quality and taste of the food were mediocre. \n",
      "\n",
      "Cons:\n",
      "Seafood section was not fresh at all. Crab legs tasted like they have been in the fridge for a very long time and the flavor was gone. Stone crab was COMPLETELY tasteless. Oysters were fishy and not sweet and creamy at all. Fish was completely overdone. Clams had sand and mussels were fishy. The entire seafood section which we were very looking forward to, was a complete fail. \n",
      "\n",
      "Hint: If you are looking for more flavorful crab legs, head on back to the Italian section, where they steam the crab legs and serve an abundance amount to your plate. These crab legs had so much more flavor than the cold ones at the seafood station. My bf and I both redeemed a little bit of happiness from these crab legs.\n",
      "\n",
      "Pros:\n",
      "Meat section and the soups. I really enjoyed their lamb chops and beef ribs here. The beef rib was one of the highlights of our meal. It was fresh off the grill, crunchy, and sooo flavorful. The lamb chops were a bit overcooked, but flavorful. The prime rib was good and the sausages were good as well. One of my favorites of the buffet was actually the truffle mushroom soup. The mushroom and truffle flavors were strong and the soup was creamy. Delicious. \n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, everything else was just mediocre and not memorable. The sushi section was almost non-existent. If you are looking to get sashimi, this ain't the place for you. Bacchanal is more focused on the large variety of food selection, but totally lacking in taste. We most likely won't come back to this buffet. For $54.99 which is more expensive than other Vegas buffets, we expected a lot better seafood quality!\n",
      "\n",
      "    4 - \n",
      "You won't be disappointed with this buffet. It's different from most buffet. They have some interesting dish. \n",
      "\n",
      "Service: The staff was friendly and nice. \n",
      "\n",
      "Food: I love that they have crab legs, raw oysters and snow crab legs. They have a small selection of sushi though. They have tonkatsu ramen, udon, pho and dimsum. I didn't try these because I didn't want to be full from them. They also have ceviche, tacos, Italian dishes and lamb. Desserts included macaroons, gelato, crepes and a bunch more. Wasn't disappointed at all.\n",

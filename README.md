# Yelp Challenge (Foodie Challenge)
Yelp dataset challenge: NLP; sentiment analysis; Restaurant Recommendation System

This projects use Yelp Dataset challenge data containing restaurant comments from Yelp users all over U.S., business information of restaurants registered on Yelp.

In this project, I selected comments from year 2016 to year 2018 to train and test my model. All together, the raw data is of size ~1GB. There're three main sections of this projects:
* data preprocessing
* NLP and sentiment analysis (Naive Bayes Classifier)
* recommendation system
